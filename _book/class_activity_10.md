students <- tibble(
  id = 1:24,
  grade = sample(c("9th", "10th", "11th"), 24, replace = TRUE),
  region = sample(c("North America", "Europe", "Asia", "South America", "Middle East", "Africa"), 24, replace = TRUE),
  score = round(runif(24,50, 100))
)
```


### a. Create a new column `grade_fac` by converting the grade column into a factor. Reorder the levels of `grade_fac` to be "9th", "10th", and "11th". Sort the dataset based on the `grade_fac` column.

### b. Create a new column `region_fac` by converting the `region` column into a factor. Collapse the `region_fac` levels into three categories: "Americas", "EMEA" and "Asia". Count the number of students in each collapsed region category.

### c. Create a new column `grade_infreq` that is a copy of the `grade_fac` column. Reorder the levels of `grade_infreq` based on their frequency in the dataset. Print the levels of `grade_infreq` to check the ordering.

### d. Create a new column `grade_lumped` by lumping the least frequent level of the `grade_fac` column into an 'Others' category. Count the number of students in each of the categories of the `grade_lumped` column.
